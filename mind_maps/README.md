Mind maps related to the development of MAEC can be found here. Currently stored are the following:

-MAEC_Malware_Capabilities: The current implementation of MAEC's malware capabilities, or high-level malware goals. This also extends down to the Behavioral and Action level, and we are using it as the basis for the Mechanisms implementation that we are incorporating into MAEC for v4.1.

These mind maps were created in and updated with FreeMind; we recommend using the latest development version, found here: http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
